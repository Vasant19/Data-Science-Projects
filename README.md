# Data-Science-Projects
Involving 7 different modularized algorithms for different Use-cases and problem solutions
#### All the machine learning models follow same Directory structure and flow while everything else, from dataset to algorithm selection being different. The Package Module necessities in requirements.txt are also mostly similar.

## First step is to Clone the repository
```python
git clone https://github.com/Vasant19/Data-Science-Projects.git
```
## Second step is to Install the requirements.txt
```python
pip install requirements.txt
```

## Third step and final step is to Change the directory in the terminal you want to run or edit hyperparameters of a model
#### For example: 
```python
cd "House Price Prediction"
```

## Run the file
```python
python MLMAIN.py
```
